Reusable whiteboard template (for any model)

Header
#[n] Model name — one-line goal

1) What decision this powers
	•	Plain English: what gets shown/assigned/triggered.

2) Known constants & units (pre-known “glossary”)
	•	Global window/horizon, time units, money units, refresh cadence, any fixed policy knobs.

3) Inputs (from data)
	•	List fields you pull (by table), and how you derive any per-customer/per-item features.

4) Symbols & hyperparameters (store-level)
	•	Symbols you’ll write in formulas (with units & constraints).
	•	Which are estimated hyperparameters vs fixed constants.

5) Expressions you’ll write (in order)
	•	A → B → C in the exact sequence you’ll compute by hand.
	•	Note any special functions and the approximation you’ll use on the whiteboard.

6) Step-by-step workflow (one example)
	•	Bullet the calculation steps you’ll execute for one row/customer/item.
	•	Keep running totals in the margin.

7) Sanity checks
	•	Parameter constraints, unit check, and quick “does this number make sense?” bounds.

8) Output & how it’s used
	•	What value or label you emit; any thresholds/tiers/caps.
