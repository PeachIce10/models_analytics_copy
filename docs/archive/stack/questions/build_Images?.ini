It means package your code into a container (Docker) so it can run anywhere.
	‚Ä¢	Create a Dockerfile for each job/service (build your Go binary, copy into image).
	‚Ä¢	Run docker build -t your-registry/app:version . to produce the image.
	‚Ä¢	Push it to a registry; your scheduler (Kubernetes CronJob/Deployment) runs that image.


Not a picture üôÇ. A container image is a packaged filesystem + startup metadata that your code runs from‚Äîthink ‚Äúzip of everything the app needs, plus instructions to start it.‚Äù

What an image is
	‚Ä¢	A read-only bundle of files (your binary, libs, CA certs, etc.) plus a default command.
	‚Ä¢	Built in layers from a Dockerfile (each RUN/COPY adds a layer).
	‚Ä¢	Immutable & versioned (tags like signals:1.0.0), so the same image runs the same everywhere.

Why it matters
	‚Ä¢	Reproducible: same deps on dev/CI/prod.
	‚Ä¢	Portable: K8s pulls the image from a registry and runs it as a container.
	‚Ä¢	Isolated & slim: no ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù issues; tiny runtime (often a single static Go binary).

How it‚Äôs built & used (flow)
	1.	You write a Dockerfile.
	2.	docker build -t registry/app:1.0.0 . ‚Üí creates the image.
	3.	docker push registry/app:1.0.0 ‚Üí stores it in your registry.
	4.	Kubernetes Pod/CronJob spec references image: registry/app:1.0.0; it pulls and runs it.

‚ÄúCopy into image‚Äù means‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	In your Dockerfile, COPY places your compiled Go binary (and any needed files) into the image filesystem.

Minimal multi-stage Dockerfile (Go service)

# build stage
FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /out/signals ./signals/cmd

# runtime stage (tiny, no shell)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /out/signals /app/signals
USER nonroot:nonroot
EXPOSE 8080 9090
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/signals"]

Minimal Dockerfile (Go batch job)

FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /out/job ./analytics/jobs/customer/clv_bgnbd/cmd

FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot
WORKDIR /job
COPY --from=build /out/job /job/job
ENTRYPOINT ["/job/job"]

Run it locally (quick sanity)

docker build -t myreg/analytics/signals:1.0.0 .
docker run -p 8080:8080 myreg/analytics/signals:1.0.0

That‚Äôs it: the ‚Äúimage‚Äù is a portable, versioned snapshot of your app+deps; K8s pulls it and runs your Go binary the same way everywhere.
