Brief summary:
You want a two-pass process handled by another thread.
	•	Pass 1: They read four files, deduplicate overlapping content, and produce a single, clean resource of signals/flows/platform notes—no modeling judgments yet.
	•	Pass 2: After seeing our 15 models, they map the deduplicated signals to models (keep/reject), propose groupings per model, and flag any small subset flows that act as add-on extrapolations to the main 15. Then you and I will review.

⸻

Prompt 1 — Deduplicate the 4 files into one canonical resource

Goal: Produce a single, clean, deduplicated list of signals/flows/platform notes from four input files. Do not classify by model yet. No opinions—only consolidation.

Instructions:
	1.	Read all 4 files in full.
	2.	Deduplicate: merge identical or near-identical items; remove repeats; unify naming.
	3.	Normalize each signal/flow into one row with these fields:
	•	name (canonical snake_case), scope (one of: customer, visitor, session, device, browser, product, store/tenant, global),
	•	description (1–2 lines),
	•	source_system (e.g., mongo:<collection>, event_stream, clickhouse:<table>, postgres:<table>),
	•	keys (e.g., store_id, user_id, session_id, product_id),
	•	datatype (bool/int/float/string/jsonb/timestamp),
	•	unit (e.g., cents, count, %, iso8601),
	•	freshness_hint (e.g., real-time / daily / weekly),
	•	origin_files (list of the 4 files where it appeared),
	•	notes (only if needed, e.g., alias names encountered).
	4.	Group the output by scope (customer / visitor / session / device / browser / product / store).
	5.	Keep flows/platform notes (e.g., channels, SEO, social, finance) as signals with scope session or store/tenant and a clear description; mark them as “flow_hint” in notes.
	6.	Do not map to models, do not infer features, do not drop items unless exact duplicates. If two items differ only by naming, merge and list aliases in notes.
	7.	Output format: a single Markdown document titled “Signals Canonical v1 (Deduplicated)” with:
	•	a short preface (what you did),
	•	a compact table per scope with the fields above,
	•	an Appendix A: Alias Map (old names → canonical),
	•	an Appendix B: Open Questions (ambiguous items you could not dedupe without losing meaning).

Context constraints (use these while normalizing):
	•	Primary raw source today is MongoDB feature collections (discount, product, order, cart, brand, category, subcategory, etc.).
	•	Analytics outputs live in Postgres/ClickHouse; you can reference them as potential destinations, but do not reclassify now.
	•	Money in cents, timestamps iso8601.
	•	Keys are always tenant-scoped via store_id, optionally merchant_id.

Deliverable: A single Markdown file ≤ 2 pages if possible (can spill to 3), strictly deduplicated, no model mapping.

Prompt 2 — Map the deduplicated signals to our 15 models; propose subsets; filter noise

Goal: Using “Signals Canonical v1 (Deduplicated)”, map signals to the 15 models below, propose subset flows where useful, and filter out irrelevant items.

Models (what they do & how they use signals):
	1.	Customer CLV (BG/NBD + Gamma–Gamma): needs order margins, recency/frequency/tenure; outputs CLV, tier.
	2.	Two-Stage Recommender (PDP/PLP): retrieves candidates, ranks by expected net margin; uses product signals, stock, returns, user/visitor context.
	3.	Basket / Session Re-rank: cart add-ons only if net gain > risk; uses cart items, attach priors, distraction risk, stock.
	4.	Promotion Uplift: per-arm incremental GM; budget/caps; uses campaign history, offer costs, user features.
	5.	Customer Personas: clusters customers; uses R/F/M + engagement + category/brand shares (can include nav aggregates).
	6.	Affinities (Brand/Category): time-decayed counts; Dirichlet smoothing; brand/category preferences.
	7.	Product Similarity / Clustering: co-buy graph, cosine/PPMI; neighbor lists; optional ANN for serving.
	8.	PLP/Search Ranking (RankNet): pairwise ranking; uses search logs (query, clicks), lexical/semantic/business features.
	9.	Markdown Optimizer: price ladders over weeks; needs stock, demand quantiles, margins, salvage.
	10.	Price Elasticity: log-log demand; price/units history; suggests base price within guardrails.
	11.	Upsell Propensity: show upsell if profit gain exceeds base risk; needs acceptance priors, base order GM.
	12.	Cross-sell (Complements): complements for hero item; uses co-buy lift, cosine, substitutes, stock.
	13.	Bundle Optimizer: pair slow-movers with heroes; attach vs cannibalization; constraints.
	14.	Churn Propensity: treat when expected saved margin > cost; uses recency/engagement/complaints/spend.
	15.	Lifecycle Timing (HSMM): state transitions (Active/At-Risk/Lapsed); weekly sequences of visits and orders.

Instructions:
	1.	Read the deduplicated resource you created in Prompt 1.
	2.	For each model (1–15), produce three lists:
	•	Required signals (must have),
	•	Useful signals (improves accuracy),
	•	Nice-to-have (optional; use if available).
For each signal, include: name, scope, source_system, keys, unit, and a 1-line justification.
	3.	Propose subset flows (if any): compact, self-contained feature groups that enhance the model (e.g., “checkout-intent cohort” for Upsell; “brand-loyalty boost” for Recommender). Mark them as subset_flow_for: <model#> and list exact signals they use.
	4.	Filter out irrelevant signals: provide a short “Excluded signals” list with 1-line reasons (e.g., superadmin-only ops data).
	5.	Per-signal granularity: specify if signals should be per-customer, per-visitor/session, per-product, or per-tenant.
	6.	Output format: a Markdown doc titled “Signals → Models Map v1” with a section for each model (1–15), each showing Required/Useful/Nice-to-have, a Subset flows subsection, and a final Excluded signals section. Keep it concise (≤ 2–3 pages total; bullets, not prose).

Constraints & context (apply while mapping):
	•	Raw features primarily from MongoDB feature collections; analytics outputs live in PG/CH.
	•	Use store_id for tenant scoping; prefer cents and iso8601 timestamps.
	•	Real-time GraphQL serving expected for #2, #3, #7, #8, #11, #12; others are batch unless you justify otherwise.
	•	Visitor cohorts and customer signals are allowed as feature providers; if your mapping needs them, name them explicitly.

Deliverable: “Signals → Models Map v1” as described, ready for us to review and finalize what to keep for each model.

















Now you are going to take the "Deduplicated Compilation" resource you've just made for me and follow the prompt below which will start where I say "prompt starts here" amd end where i say "prompt ends here". Then, the numbered model list after it says "prompt ends here" is simply context to help you follow your job when following the prompt. Its a streamlined list of the 15 models that we are using broken down into goal, outputs, serve, activation, prereqs, and KPIs followed by one sentence long list of what each of the 15 models are for to help with understanding these models even more for fast and easy referencing while you carry out your job when following the prompt. Then I also attach the three PDFs which is the math and model of the 15 were using which you will also use as context to enrich the result and accuracy when following the prompt which you will be deriving from the deduplicated resource you've just provided. ---> "prompt starts here": Prompt: Goal: Using “Signals Canonical v1 (Deduplicated)”, map signals to the 15 models below, propose subset flows where useful, and filter out irrelevant items.

  Context: 
  1.	Predicts each customer’s profit over the next six months and assigns VIP/High/Med/Low tiers. It does this by looking at how often they buy and how much margin they usually generate to forecast future value.
	2.	Decides which products to show first on product and category pages to lift profit. It pulls a shortlist from browsing and buying signals and then ranks items by expected margin while honoring stock and diversity limits.
	3.	Suggests add-ons in the cart only when they’re likely to raise profit without hurting checkout. It estimates the extra margin from each add-on and weighs it against any risk of distracting the shopper.
	4.	Chooses the best offer for each customer to maximize incremental profit within a campaign budget. It predicts the lift from each offer and allocates offers where they pay off the most under caps.
	5.	Groups customers into clear personas for messaging and merchandising. It finds natural clusters in behavior and keeps the stable, well-separated ones.
	6.	Scores each customer’s brand and category preferences for targeting and first-slot placement. It counts recent interactions with a time decay and smooths sparse data to produce reliable top tags.
	7.	Finds similar products and product clusters to power “you may also like” and discovery. It learns which items are bought together and uses that pattern to surface neighbors and build groups.
	8.	Orders search and listing results so the most relevant, high-performing items appear first. It learns from past clicks and purchases and blends in freshness, price, stock, and promotions.
	9.	Plans weekly price markdowns to clear inventory by a deadline while maximizing total profit. It balances expected demand at each price with remaining stock and salvage value to pick the best ladder.
	10.	Estimates how demand responds to price and suggests a sensible base price within guardrails. It fits a simple relationship between price and units sold and simulates outcomes before recommending.
	11.	Decides when to show an upsell so profit per order rises without lowering conversion. It predicts acceptance and subtracts any expected dip in the base purchase before green-lighting the offer.
	12.	Recommends complementary products for the item in the cart or on the page. It uses product relationships and filters out substitutes and low-stock picks, then ranks by expected profit.
	13.	Builds bundles that pair slow movers with hero items to boost sell-through without hurting hero margins. It scores each pairing by extra profit after cannibalization and picks the best set under constraints.
	14.	Flags customers at risk of leaving and only treats them when it’s expected to pay off. It compares the value of saving the customer to the cost of the action and prioritizes the winners.
	15.	Detects when customers shift from active to at-risk to lapsed so win-backs land at the right time. It reads recent activity patterns to update the current state and trigger outreach.
