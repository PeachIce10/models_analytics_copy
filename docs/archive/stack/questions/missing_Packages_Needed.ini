Here’s what I didn’t see in the trees you shared that you’ll need to run all models end-to-end:

Containerization & Runtime
	•	Dockerfiles for each job (analytics/jobs/**) and the signals service.
	•	Kubernetes (or runner) manifests: CronJobs (batch) and Deployments/Service (signals).
	•	Image registry config and tags/versioning policy.

IaC & CI/CD
	•	Terraform/Pulumi modules for DBs, networking, K8s cluster, Secrets.
	•	CI/CD pipeline (build, test, docker build/push, deploy apply).

Secrets & Config
	•	Secret defs for DSNs: CORE_PG_DSN, CORE_CH_DSN, SIGNALS_PG_DSN, SIGNALS_CH_DSN.
	•	Mount/Env wiring for analytics/configs/*.yaml and signals.yaml in jobs/services.

Serving & Ops (signals/)
	•	opsStatus schema/resolver files (mentioned in safety.yaml):
signals/internal/graph/schema/ops.graphqls, ops.resolver.go.
	•	Boot checks + SLO checks implemented in signals/internal/store/factory.go (logic, not just plan).
	•	Health endpoints wiring (/healthz, /readyz) in signals/cmd/main.go.

Model Code Gaps (algorithms/jobs not present yet)
	•	CLV (#1) fitting + scoring job (BG/NBD + Gamma–Gamma) and a place to persist hyperparameters.
	•	RankNet training job (if you’ll learn weights offline for #8).
	•	ANN index builder/loader (if you choose FAISS/Milvus/OpenSearch for #2/#7/#12).
	•	Markdown DP/MILP solver hook (#9) and HDBSCAN job (#5) libraries.
	•	Churn (#14), Lifecycle HSMM (#15), Promotion Uplift knapsack (#4): job skeletons + pipelines not in tree.

Schemas / Contracts
	•	JSON schemas for additional outputs beyond the three you have:
e.g., tiers/clv, bundles, cross-sell lists, churn_risk, lifecycle_state, rank weights.
	•	Matching signals bindings for any new datasets in configs/signals.yaml.

Datastore Helpers
	•	Read helpers for any new inputs (e.g., returns, price history, search logs) in common/datastore/{postgres,clickhouse}.go.
	•	Upsert helpers that include (id, model_version, as_of) for new tables.

Monitoring
	•	Metrics emission (counters/gauges) hooks in jobs and signals (per safety.yaml), plus dashboard wiring.

If you want, I can draft minimal Dockerfiles and K8s CronJob/Deployment templates to drop into this layout.




Yes—makes sense. Here’s the split you’re asking for.

Heavy “system packages / setups” (provisioned services)
	•	Container build & runtime: Docker / BuildKit on CI runners.
	•	Orchestrator: Kubernetes (Deployments for signals, CronJobs for jobs/**), or ECS/Nomad equivalent.
	•	Container registry service: ECR/GCR/ACR or Docker Hub (the registry itself is the “heavy” piece).
	•	Datastores: Postgres and ClickHouse clusters (HA, backups, retention).
	•	Secrets manager: AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager / Vault.
	•	CI/CD runners: GitHub Actions/GitLab/CircleCI (builders, credentials, environments).
	•	Observability stack: Prometheus + Grafana (or CloudWatch/Stackdriver), and logs (ELK/Loki).
	•	Optional engines:
	•	ANN service (OpenSearch k-NN / Milvus / FAISS-serving) for similarity.
	•	Optimizer solver runtime (OR-Tools or CBC/GLPK) for markdown/knapsack.
	•	Python runtime (if you call non-Go libs for HDBSCAN/optimizers).

Light “files/config you write” (checked into repo)
	•	Dockerfiles for each job and the signals service.
	•	Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, CronJobs, ConfigMaps, Secrets references).
	•	Registry config & tagging policy (repo names, tags, push rules) — light; registry itself is heavy.
	•	Env/Secret definitions for DSNs (CORE_PG_DSN, CORE_CH_DSN, SIGNALS_*).
	•	Model configs: analytics/configs/*.yaml (windows, IO stores, SLOs, versions).
	•	Serving map: analytics/configs/signals.yaml.
	•	Schemas: analytics/schemas/models/*.json.
	•	Contracts: signals/proto/*.proto, GraphQL *.graphqls.
	•	Metrics scrape config (targets/labels) if self-managing Prometheus.

In short: you must provision the heavy services above; everything else is code + YAML you already know how to author and version.



Got it. Here’s a tight map from your analytics/ tree to what’s already implemented vs. what to add inside those files, plus what’s missing entirely to run all models.

⸻

Implemented files → add what’s missing inside them

configs/**
	•	[Implemented] configs/*.yaml and configs/signals.yaml
	•	Add: DSN env keys per dataset (CORE_PG_DSN, CORE_CH_DSN, SIGNALS_*), job_slo blocks (timeout/retries), model_version, and SLOs (freshness_hours, min_rows, timeouts_ms) in signals.yaml.

common/**
	•	[Implemented] common/config/load.go
	•	Add: strict schema validation (required keys), env overrides, clear errors.
	•	[Implemented] common/datastore/postgres.go, clickhouse.go
	•	Add: context.WithTimeout on all calls, helpers: SelectFreshness(table), SelectCount(table), UpsertRows(table, rows, keys=[id,model_version,as_of]), readers for returns, price history, search logs (needed by other models).
	•	[Implemented] common/timewin/window.go
	•	Add: presets for last_30d/90d/180d/365d and custom ranges.

jobs/**
	•	[Implemented] RFM, velocity, abcxyz, affinity job skeletons (cmd/main.go, pipeline/*, *_validate.go)
	•	Add: per-job deadlines from job_slo, retry/backoff, rows-written metrics, dedupe on (id,model_version,as_of), consistent logging.
	•	[Missing models within jobs]: CLV, RankNet train, Promotion uplift, Upsell, Cross-sell, Bundle, Markdown optimizer, Elasticity, Personas (HDBSCAN), Churn, Lifecycle (HSMM).

schemas/models/**
	•	[Implemented] customer_segments.schema.json, product_signals.schema.json, affinity_edges.schema.json
	•	Add: fields and keys for new outputs (tiers/clv, bundles, cross_sell, churn_risk, lifecycle_state, rank_weights), include model_version and as_of constraints.

signals/cmd/**
	•	[Implemented] signals/cmd/main.go
	•	Add: load signals.yaml, inject default request timeouts, /healthz + /readyz endpoints, one boot log line with bindings.

signals/internal/store/**
	•	[Implemented] factory.go, interfaces.go, postgres/*, clickhouse/*
	•	Add: boot checks (mapping→impl, DSN ping), freshness/row SLO probes, fail-fast on error.

signals/internal/services/**
	•	[Implemented] *_signals_service.go
	•	Add: metrics (dataset_ok, rows, maxAgeHours), consistent errors, paging guard.

signals/internal/validators/**
	•	[Implemented]
	•	Add: enforce slo.paging.max_limit, required IDs, numeric clamps.

signals/internal/graph/schema/**
	•	[Implemented] customer_signals.graphqls, product_signals.graphqls, affinity_signals.graphqls (+ resolvers)
	•	Add: ops.graphqls + ops.resolver.go (OpsStatus), GraphQL types for any new datasets.

signals/proto/**
	•	[Implemented] *.proto
	•	Add: pagination defaults, version fields where needed, new protos for future datasets (clv/tiers, bundles, churn, lifecycle, rank).

⸻

Missing entirely (system packages / setups)
	•	Containerization: Dockerfiles for each job and signals service.
	•	Orchestration: Kubernetes manifests (CronJobs for jobs; Deployment/Service for signals).
	•	Registry: ECR/GCR/ACR (repo + push policy).
	•	Secrets manager: store DSNs (CORE_*, SIGNALS_*), mounted as env.
	•	CI/CD: build/test → docker build/push → kubectl/Helm apply (or Terraform apply).
	•	Observability: Prometheus/Grafana (or cloud metrics), log shipping, alert rules (SLO breaches, boot failures).
	•	Optional engines: ANN service (OpenSearch k-NN/Milvus/FAISS) and solver runtime (OR-Tools/GLPK) for similarity/optimizers.

⸻

Nice-to-have small files (lightweight configs)
	•	Metrics scrape config (if self-hosting Prometheus).
	•	Registry/tagging policy doc (image names, versioning).
	•	Runbooks README for jobs and signals ops.

This gives you a checklist of what you’ve already scaffolded vs. what to add per file and what infra you still need to provision.
