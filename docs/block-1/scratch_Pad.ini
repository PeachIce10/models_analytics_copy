Great question — here’s the quick decode:
	•	Those symbols (r, α, a, b, p, q, γ) are NOT universal defaults.
They’re store-specific hyperparameters you fit once from your historical data (the 365-day calibration window), then reuse for every customer.
	•	Two kinds of inputs feed the CLV math:
	1.	Global hyperparameters (fit once for your store/segment):
	•	BG/NBD (incidence): r, α, a, b
– fit by maximum likelihood on all customers’ purchase timings in the window.
– constraints: a > 1, r > 0, α > 0, b > 0.
	•	Gamma–Gamma (monetary): p, q, γ
– fit on customers with ≥1 purchase using their per-txn margins.
– constraints: p > 0, q > 1, γ > 0.
	2.	Per-customer stats (computed directly from that customer’s data):
	•	x (repeat purchase count in the window), T (customer “age” in days), t_x (recency in days), \bar m (average per-transaction margin, in cents).
	•	How to get the hyperparameters quickly (pick one):
	•	Fit by MLE in Python/R (e.g., “lifetimes” style) or in Excel Solver by maximizing log-likelihood; seed with reasonable guesses.
	•	Until you fit them, you can use your earlier toy values just to practice the whiteboard flow—but final CLV must use fitted values.
	•	What I meant by “tell me the hyperparameters and one customer row”:
If you give me your fitted r, α, a, b, p, q, γ plus one customer’s x, T, t_x, \bar m, I’ll walk you line-by-line through:
	1.	expected per-transaction margin (Gamma–Gamma),
	2.	expected transactions on the 180-day horizon (BG/NBD),
	3.	multiply for CLV and place the tier.

If you want starter guess values just to dry-run the board (not for production), reuse the ones you used earlier: r=0.8, α=30, a=1.5, b=3.0, p=6, q=4.5, γ=2000—then swap in fitted values once you’ve run your estimation.
